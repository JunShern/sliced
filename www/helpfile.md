Sliced is a web app built in R and the Shiny framework, for a specific task in data exploration: counting repeated values of variables in datasets. R users may be familiar with this as using `dplyr`'s `summarise()` to collapse datasets by count (this is indeed how it is implemented), whereas Microsoft Excel users would know it as pivoting fields as rows, with values as counts. 

The advantage of Sliced (besides being a portable web app) is that it is designed in a user-friendly manner, specifically for users who need to repeatedly segment their data into smaller chunks.

The project was started for myself as an educational exploration into R and Shiny but feature requests or even better, pull requests are welcome from anyone who thinks it would be useful to be developed into a more fully-featured program!
